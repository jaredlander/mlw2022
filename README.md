# Machine Learning Week 2022

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Thanks for attending my sessions at [Machine Learning Week
2022](https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningweek/).
This repo will hold code from both the [R
Bootcamp](https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningweek/workshops/r-bootcamp/)
workshop and the [Machine Learning in
R](https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningweek/workshops/machine-learning-with-r/)
session.

## Setup

For this course you need a recent version of R. Anything greater than
4.0 is good but 4.2 is even better. I also highly recommend using your
IDE/code editor of choice. Most people use either
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [R Language
Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r).

After you have R and your favorite editor installed, you should install
the packages needed today with the following line of code.

``` r
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'ggthemes', 'ggridges', 'tidymodels', 'coefplot', 'glmnet', 'xgboost', 'vip'))
```

## Code

Throughout the class I will be pushing code to this repo in case you
need to catch up. Most, if not all, will be in the `code` folder.
